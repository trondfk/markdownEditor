# Release v1.0.1: A heart on the toolbar

## Features

- A small heart sits at the end of the toolbar. Click it to see what it says. It is meant for one particular person, it changes nothing in the document, and it can be moved or hidden from Settings like any other toolbar button

---

# Release v1.0.0: Text highlighting, Norwegian, and a fix for disappearing text

This is the first release from the independent fork at `trondfk/markdownEditor`. Builds from here check this repository for updates and are signed with its own key. An installation from the upstream project keeps following upstream, so moving to this fork means installing it once by hand.

The version restarts at 1.0.0 rather than continuing the 0.7.x line, so that a version number always refers to one project and one set of installers. Everything the 0.7.x releases could do is still here.

## Features

- Highlight text in six colours from the toolbar, and clear a highlight again from the same menu. Highlights are stored in the document as inline HTML, so they survive saving, closing and reopening the file
- Norwegian (Bokmål) interface, selectable from settings alongside English
- The AI assistant summarises earlier turns by itself once a conversation grows long, instead of asking you to start over in a new chat. The summary shows up in the chat as a marker you can expand and read
- Drag the edge of the AI panel, the split view and the code-and-preview editor to resize them, and the sizes are remembered the next time you open the app

## Bug fixes

- Fix saved text disappearing. Editing in code view, the split editor or a large file and then letting auto-save run, closing the window, or dragging the tab into another window could write an empty document over your work. Every automatic save now reads from the editor you are actually typing in, and refuses any write that would empty a file that was not empty
- Keep long conversations with local models inside the context window by sizing the replayed history to the model's own context setting rather than a fixed limit

## UI/UX

- The AI panel docks as a real pane beside the document instead of floating above it, so it no longer covers the text while you write
- Highlighted text stays readable in dark mode, where it used to be near-white on a pale background
- Polish and Chinese are no longer offered as interface languages, and the Polish and Chinese text that remained in messages, comments and documentation is now English

# Release v0.7.3 — Math formulas and easier Codex setup

## Features

- Add inline and display math formulas, including fractions, matrices and multi-line equations, with common LaTeX delimiters and fenced math blocks (#144)
- Edit formulas directly in the visual editor while preserving their original Markdown syntax on save (#144)
- Include rendered formulas in PDF exports even offline, support alternative formula syntax in slides, and retain LaTeX source as text in Word exports (#144)

## Bug fixes

- Find Codex in more Windows installation locations, including installations managed by the desktop app, and reject desktop launchers that cannot run as a CLI (#144)
- Refresh automatically detected Codex paths when checking again, respect manually selected paths, and use the verified installation for conversations (#144)

## UI/UX

- Add toolbar buttons for inline and display formulas, with double-click or keyboard editing (#144)
- Expand manual executable selection after connection errors and explain which Codex file to choose (#144)

---

# Release v0.7.2 — Layout fixes and optional startup checks

## Features

- Add a setting to skip the Claude and Codex checks at startup — the status bar then shows the last-known status, and opening the AI assistant or pressing Re-check refreshes it (#142)

## Bug fixes

- Remove the stray vertical scrollbars that could appear on an empty document and on the tab bar (#140)
- Keep the document centered in the visible editor area when the AI panel is open, instead of letting it slide underneath the panel (#141)

---

# Release v0.7.1 — ELK layout for Mermaid diagrams

Flowcharts can now be arranged by the ELK layout engine, which keeps arrows from crossing and stacking on top of each other.

## Features

- Arrange any flowchart with the ELK engine by adding `layout: elk` at the top of the diagram; dense architecture diagrams keep straighter lanes and far fewer overlapping arrows (#138)
- Insert a ready-made ELK flowchart from the quick template buttons above the diagram editor, or from the full template list (#138)

---

# Release v0.7.0 — Big files, richer code, polished READMEs

Open and edit multi-megabyte Markdown without freezing, see Markdown structure clearly in Code View, and render common README HTML directly in Visual Mode.

<p>

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trondfk/markdownEditor/main/assets/screenshots/readme-html-rendering.png" alt="MerMark v0.7.0 — README HTML rendered in Visual Mode" width="48%" />
</p>

## Features

- Open and edit multi-megabyte Markdown directly in a responsive Visual Mode; MerMark renders only the nearby sections as you move through the document (#136)
- See headings, lists, emphasis, links, quotes, inline code, and fenced blocks in distinct colors in Code View — including in very large files (#136)
- Render common README HTML such as centered sections, bold and emphasized text, links, images, linked badges, and collapsible details without rewriting the original Markdown source (#136)
- Drop supported Markdown and text files from your file manager into a workspace folder; existing files are never overwritten (#136)

## Bug fixes

- Fixed the app freezing when opening or selecting a large Markdown file, including multi-megabyte documents (#129, #136)
- Fixed switching between Visual and Code views losing the matching line or highlighting the wrong repeated HTML block (#136)
- Fixed repeated view switching shortening or skipping the Code View cursor highlight; every switch now starts a fresh smooth fade (#136)
- Fixed HTML links and linked badges opening inside MerMark; they now use the external-link confirmation before opening the browser (#136)
- Fixed loading an externally changed file leaving Code View out of sync (#136)
- Fixed saved workspaces inside dot-prefixed Linux directories becoming unreadable after restarting MerMark, including visible symlinks that point into hidden directories (#133, #136)

## UI/UX

- Large documents keep the same comfortable page width as regular documents while their content loads lazily (#136)
- The table of contents stays responsive on large files and can jump directly to sections that have not been rendered yet (#136)
- Moving between Visual and Code views restores the corresponding source or rendered line with a smooth highlight (#136)

---

# Release v0.6.5 — Links inside your document jump where they should

## Bug fixes

- Fix clicking a `[Section](#section)` link doing nothing at all; it now scrolls to the heading (#132)
- Fix headings containing dashes, ampersands, accented letters or non-Latin script getting anchors no link could reach, so Polish and Chinese headings now work like any other (#132)
- Fix links to a repeated heading always landing on the first one; every repeat now gets its own anchor (#132)
- Fix anchor links searching the wrong side in split view instead of the pane you are looking at (#132)
- Fix a document containing an unusual numeric character code failing to open (#132)

## UI/UX

- Heading anchors now match the ones GitHub produces, so a link copied out of a document rendered on GitHub resolves here too. Links written against MerMark's older anchors still work where the two differ only in dashes; the few that leaned on how ampersands or accented letters used to be handled need updating (#132)
- Show a notice when a link points at a heading the document does not contain, instead of leaving the click looking like nothing happened (#132)

---

# Release v0.6.4 — Drag folders in, reveal files properly, native Wayland

## Features

- Add a workspace by dragging a folder from your file manager straight onto the sidebar; drop several at once, and a folder you already have open is focused instead of added twice (#127)

## Bug fixes

- Fix "Reveal in file manager" opening your Documents folder instead of the file or folder you picked on Windows, which affected the workspace tree, the workspace header icon and the tab context menu alike (#127)
- Fix markdown files dragged in from the file manager opening as untitled copies; they now open as the real file, so Ctrl+S saves straight away and relative images load (#127)
- Fix the Linux AppImage running through the X11 compatibility layer on Wayland desktops, which caused glitches when resizing the window (#127)

## UI/UX

- Dragging inside the workspace tree feels steadier: press Escape to cancel a drag in progress, and the list scrolls on its own when you drag near the top or bottom edge (#127)

---

# Release v0.6.3 — Tab indentation and font fixes

## Features

- Indent with Tab in the code view: press Tab to insert a tab character, select multiple lines and press Tab / Shift+Tab to indent or outdent the whole block (#123)

## Bug fixes

- Fix the Editor Font setting having no effect in the Minimal theme; your chosen font now applies everywhere, and the "System Default" preset keeps Minimal's serif look (#123)
- Fix Code + Preview panes slowly scrolling on their own after you stop scrolling on macOS trackpads (#123)
- Fix Tab moving focus out of the editor instead of editing your document (#123)
- Fix lists nested with tabs being flattened to a single level when switching between Code and Visual views (#123)

## UI/UX

- Tab in the visual editor now indents and outdents list items, inserts a tab inside code blocks, and never kicks the cursor out of your document (#123)

---

# Release v0.6.2 — Indented code blocks keep their indentation

## Bug fixes

- Keep the indentation of code blocks written with 4-space indents (like directory trees or ASCII diagrams). They now render as proper code blocks in Visual mode, show up unchanged in Code mode, and saving no longer strips the spacing or rewrites them as fenced blocks. (#119)

---

# Release v0.6.1 — Image, scrolling, and navigation fixes

## Bug fixes

- Keep images that sit inside a list item when you switch to code view. They were disappearing and getting wiped from the file when you saved. (#115)
- Stay where you are in a document when it changes on disk and reloads, instead of jumping back to the top. Useful while an AI agent edits the file as you read. (#113)

## UI/UX

- Clicking a heading in the Table of Contents now brings it to the top of the view with its section below, instead of pushing it down to the bottom. (#114)

---

# Release v0.6.0 — Marp presentations

MerMark can now build slide decks. Start a presentation in markdown, watch the real slides render live next to the editor, and present them fullscreen — all without leaving the app.

## Features

- Create slide decks in MerMark: pick **Marp presentation** when starting a new file, or open any existing deck. (#116)
- A dedicated presentation toolbar appears for decks: add a slide, choose a theme (with a small preview of each), set a slide's layout, add a slide background from a file or a link, toggle slide numbers, switch aspect ratio, and change the font size. (#116)
- Live slide preview: edit on the left and see the finished slides on the right, with the two sides scrolling together. (#116)
- Present fullscreen, advancing with arrow keys, a click, or automatically. (#116)
- Put local images and web images on your slides — they show up both in the preview and when you export. (#116)

## Bug fixes

- Fix the garbled minus symbol on the zoom control, and restore the zoom slider to the status bar. (#116)

## UI/UX

- Slide breaks now show as clear "Slide N" dividers, and a deck's settings appear as a tidy badge instead of raw tags. (#116)
- Tidy up Polish interface wording. (#116)

---

# Release v0.5.6 — Local AI models & accurate token counting

## Features

- Chat with local AI models: connect Ollama or any OpenAI-compatible server (LM Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM) from the new sections in AI settings — no cloud account needed (#92)
- Local models can read and edit your document directly, just like the cloud assistants (#92)
- The current document rides along with each message to local models, so small models answer about your file without extra round trips (#92)
- The Codex model picker now lists the models actually available in your Codex CLI instead of a fixed list (#92)
- Added the latest Claude models to the model picker (#92)
- The context bar warns when a conversation gets close to the model's limit, so you know when to start a fresh chat (#92)
- Long conversations are compacted automatically for small-context local models, keeping older turns from crowding out your question (#92)

## Bug fixes

- The context window size now matches the model you are actually chatting with — it no longer dropped to a smaller model's limit after the first reply (#99)
- The Codex context window is detected from your installed CLI instead of a stale built-in value (#99)
- Session instructions are sent once per conversation instead of with every message, so each turn wastes fewer tokens (#99)
- Token usage no longer double-counts cached tokens on Codex (#99)
- Edits proposed by local models no longer fail on Windows documents because of line-ending differences (#92)
- Pinned-fragment markers no longer leak into the document when a local model edits a pinned section (#92)

---

# Release v0.5.5 — Linux AppImage works again on Fedora and openSUSE

## Bug fixes

- Fix the Linux AppImage opening an empty window on up-to-date distributions such as Fedora and openSUSE Tumbleweed — the package no longer ships an outdated system library that broke graphics startup (#106, #109)

---

# Release v0.5.4 — Synced scrolling & live Table of Contents

## Features

- In the Code + Preview split, scrolling either pane now keeps the other roughly aligned, so the preview follows along while you edit the source.
- The Table of Contents now highlights the section you are reading and updates automatically as you scroll through the document.

---

# Release v0.5.3 — Security updates

## Security

- Update bundled dependencies to clear outstanding Dependabot security advisories (#105).

---

# Release v0.5.2 — Linux blank-window fix

## Bug fixes

- Fix the empty/blank window on Linux so the app starts and renders correctly on recent distributions such as Fedora 44 and openSUSE Tumbleweed (#106).

---

# Release v0.5.1 — macOS printing fix

## Bug fixes

- Fix the **Print / PDF** button doing nothing on macOS — the export dialog now opens the native print dialog, where you can print or save the formatted document as a PDF (#103).

---

# Release v0.5.0 — Code + Preview split editor, accurate Claude context meter

Write Markdown and watch it render at the same time, and trust the AI context meter again. This release adds a side-by-side Code + Preview editor for the document you're working on, and fixes the Claude context-usage meter so it reflects what's actually in the window.

## Features

- **Code + Preview split.** Toggle "Code + Preview" in the toolbar to edit raw Markdown on the left and see the rendered result update live on the right — both showing the same document. Mermaid diagrams you change in the preview (by hand or with the AI button) flow back into the Markdown. (#94)

## Bug fixes

- **Claude context meter no longer over-reports.** A single reply could make it look like one turn ate ~100K tokens when the real context was a fraction of that. The meter now shows the true context size for the turn. (#99)

---

# Release v0.4.1 — Read and write multiple Mermaid fence styles

## Features

- Open Mermaid diagrams written with admonition (`:::mermaid`) or tilde (`~~~mermaid`) fences in addition to the standard triple-backtick fence — useful when working with files from Docusaurus, MkDocs or other tools that use different delimiters. (#98)
- Choose which fence style the editor uses when saving Mermaid blocks, and optionally define a custom open/close pair, from Settings → Code. (#98)

---

# Release v0.4.0 — A faster, smarter workspace

This release makes the workspace sidebar feel like a real file explorer — sort how you like, select and delete in bulk, see what's unsaved at a glance — and irons out the big PDF and checklist rough edges.

## Features

- Sort each workspace or folder by name or last modified; a folder's choice applies to everything nested inside it (#93)
- Select multiple files in the workspace with Ctrl/Shift-click and delete them in one go
- Single click selects a file, double-click opens it — drag a file straight into the editor to open it
- Drop files from your computer onto the editor: images get inserted, markdown opens as a new document
- Insert a page break from the toolbar to force a new page in the exported PDF
- Create a file or folder next to (or inside) any item from the right-click menu

## Bug fixes

- Indented and nested checklists no longer break when viewed as code (#95)
- Page breaks are kept when you save and now actually start a new page in the exported PDF
- Footnote links in exported PDFs jump to the right note
- Mermaid diagrams export to PDF with clean, readable labels instead of heavy, overflowing text
- Clicking an image in the workspace inserts it instead of opening unreadable data
- Dropping or pasting several images adds them one after another instead of replacing the previous one
- Images added to an unsaved document are stored as files, so the code view shows a link instead of a long data blob
- Deleting a multi-selection from the right-click menu now removes every selected file, matching the Delete key
- The workspace tree now scrolls to the file you open or switch to

## UI/UX

- Unsaved files are flagged with a star; hover one to preview its changes
- The table of contents shows page numbers in the exported PDF
- Right-click a tab for Copy path and Reveal in file manager
- Pinned tabs move to the front of the tab bar
- Checklist checkboxes line up with their text
- Workspace search (Ctrl+Shift+E) is now listed in the keyboard shortcuts

---

# Release v0.3.0 — Reworked PDF export and DOCX export

The PDF export is rebuilt from scratch around a live preview dialog with full control over fonts, margins, colors, headers and footers, watermarks, and page numbering. A new DOCX export ships alongside it, and tables of contents and footnotes become clickable jumps in the exported PDF.

## Features

- Open a live PDF preview with a sidebar of settings — every change shows up in the preview before you print.
- Pick from 21 named system fonts (serif/sans/mono groups) for body and headings independently, with each option rendered in its own typeface in the dropdown.
- Adjust margins per side with four independent sliders (top, right, bottom, left), or pick a preset.
- Customize accent color and table-header background.
- Add a page header and footer with three slots each (left/center/right) and template variables `{title}`, `{date}`, `{path}`, `{page}`, `{pages}`.
- Show page numbers in three formats (`1`, `1/12`, `Page 1 of 12`) and start numbering from any page.
- Drop a watermark behind the page — custom text, color, opacity, rotation, and size.
- Save and reuse named presets (three built-ins included: Corporate Report, Notes, Draft with watermark), with the last-used settings remembered.
- Auto-generate a clickable Table of Contents with selectable heading depth (H1 through H1–H6). Footnote references jump to definitions in the PDF and back-arrows return you to the reference.
- Export to DOCX from the toolbar (Word-compatible).
- Translate the entire PDF dialog and TOC labels to English, Polish, and Chinese.

## Bug fixes

- Fix Mermaid diagrams rendering as a solid black pill in the exported PDF (the serializer was picking up the toolbar icon SVG instead of the diagram).
- Fix dark-themed Mermaid diagrams losing their text in print — text is converted to native SVG so labels survive and dark backgrounds become white for readability.
- Fix the live preview not refreshing when settings changed — preview now updates as you tweak fonts, margins, header/footer, and watermark.
- Fix Mermaid diagrams clipping wrapped node labels and triggering huge empty pages in PDF — diagrams now fit on a single page and labels are no longer cut off.
- Fix Vite dev server crashing with "too many open files" by restricting dependency scanning.

## UI/UX

- Reorganize the PDF dialog into tabs (Layout / Typography / Header & Footer / TOC / Watermark) for quicker access.
- Show a font sample under each font picker so you can see what you're choosing.
- Keep headings together with their first paragraph in PDF (no more orphan headings at the bottom of a page).
- Replace native print checkboxes with crisp Unicode glyphs (☑ / ☐) in task lists.

# Release v0.2.15 — Drag, drop, and paste images straight into your notes

## Features

- Drop image files from your file manager onto the editor and they get inserted at the spot you dropped them, copied next to the document into an `images/` folder (closes #81).
- Paste images directly from the clipboard (Ctrl+V) — works for screenshots and "Copy image" from a browser; image is saved next to the document.
- Drag an image from the workspace sidebar into the editor to insert it instead of opening it as a tab.
- Workspace sidebar now lists images alongside Markdown files so you can see what got dropped in.
- New right-click options in the workspace sidebar: create a folder and copy a file's full path.

## Bug fixes

- Top-level workspace folders can now actually be collapsed; the arrow was previously ignored.
- The right-click menu on workspace files no longer hides behind the browser's built-in image menu — you can reach Delete, Rename, etc. again.

## UI/UX

- Hover over an image in the editor to get a small delete button in the corner.
- Mermaid diagrams stay readable in dark mode — boxes are dark and labels stay bright, even when the diagram source uses light colors.
- Tooltips on toolbar and sidebar buttons now appear after ~150ms instead of the browser's slow ~600ms default.

---

# Release v0.2.14 — Per-version release notes + /release-prep

## Features

- **Browse the full changelog inside the app** (#87) — a new **Full changelog →** button on the What's New modal opens a side-by-side history view: every published version on the left, the rendered notes on the right. Translations: `en`, `pl`, `zh-CN`.
- **`/release-prep` slash command + `mermark-release-notes` skill** (#87) — invoke after `gh pr create` to bump the version, author a per-version release-notes file from the PR context, and regenerate `CHANGELOG.md` in one step.

## Under the hood

- **Release notes now live in `docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z/RELEASE_NOTES.md`** (#87) — one folder per release. The app reads them straight from the bundle via Vite `import.meta.glob('?raw')` instead of fetching the GitHub Releases API at runtime. Root `RELEASE_NOTES.md` migrated to `docs/release-notes/v0.2.12/`; `v0.2.13` backfilled with the actual Alt+Up/Down content (its GitHub release body had been a copy of v0.2.12).
- **`scripts/gen-changelog.mjs`** (#87) — aggregates the folder into a root `CHANGELOG.md` in semver-desc order. Supports `--check` so CI can fail when the file is stale.
- **`scripts/bump-version.mjs`** (#87) — single source of truth for a release bump: writes `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, creates the per-version stub, and runs `gen-changelog`. Resolves the current version from `gh release list` (fallback `git describe --tags`).
- **Shared release-notes stylesheet** (#87) — the rendered-markdown CSS that lived inside `WhatsNewModal.vue` moved to `src/styles/release-notes.css` so both modals share one selector (`.release-notes-content`).

---

# Release v0.2.13 — Move lines / blocks with Alt+Up/Down

## Features

- **Alt+Up / Alt+Down — move the current line or block** (#80, #86) — Typora/Zettlr-style hotkey that reorders content without cut-and-paste. In the WYSIWYG editor it walks the schema up to the shallowest depth with a movable sibling, so paragraphs, headings, code blocks, blockquotes and list items all reorder at their natural level. Multi-block selections move as one unit, and atom nodes (Mermaid diagrams, horizontal rules, page breaks) keep their selection after the move so chained Alt+Up/Down presses work. In the source/code view the same shortcut reorders raw markdown lines; selections that end at column 0 of the next line are treated exclusively (matching VS Code / Sublime / IntelliJ).
- **Shortcut listed in Keyboard Shortcuts (`Ctrl+/`)** — with `en`, `pl`, and `zh-CN` translations.

---

# Release v0.2.12 — PDF fixes

## Bug fixes

- **PDF export now respects diagram size** — diagrams set to a smaller size are no longer stretched to full page width in the exported PDF.
- **Split view no longer duplicates content in PDF** — only the active (left) pane is printed when the editor is in split mode.

---

# Release v0.2.8 — Workspaces, Minimal Theme, AI in Diagrams

Workspace folders, a brand-new Minimal theme, AI editing for Mermaid diagrams, a near-WYSIWYG PDF export — the editor finally feels like a place you can stay in for hours, not just a quick-note tool.

<p>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trondfk/markdownEditor/main/docs/release-notes/v0.2.6/ui-light-mode.png" alt="MerMark v0.2.4 — Minimal theme, workspace sidebar, document open" width="48%" />
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trondfk/markdownEditor/main/docs/release-notes/v0.2.6/ui-with-ai-panel.png" alt="MerMark v0.2.4 — same layout with the AI Assistant docked on the right" width="48%" />
</p>

## Workspaces

- **Multi-root workspace sidebar** (#69) — open one folder, two folders, ten. Each gets a collapsible section with file tree, drag-to-reorder header, and per-workspace controls (search, new file, open folder, menu). The active workspace shows a colored dot.
- **Folder tree like Zettlr / Obsidian** — expand / collapse subdirectories, click a file to open in a new tab, right-click for OS-level reveal, rename, delete, new file / folder. Expanded folders are remembered between sessions.
- **AI sees the workspace** — when a file lives inside an open workspace, the AI preamble includes the workspace root as a *read-only* scope. Ask "summarize the meeting notes from the last two weeks" and the model can actually traverse the folder; writes still stay scoped to the active document.
- **Quick switcher** — `Ctrl+Shift+E` opens a 3-section command palette: workspaces, files (filename match), content (full-text grep across the active workspace, debounced 150 ms, capped at 5 000 files / 4 s / 200 hits so it never stalls a big tree).
- **Migration from v0.2.x** — existing `lastRoot` workspace settings are auto-migrated to the new `openWorkspaces[]` shape on first launch.

## Minimal theme

- **Mermaid-logo palette** — teal `#14b8a6` and coral `#f43f5e` over slate `#1a2028`. Light and dark variants both ship; the variant axis is orthogonal to light/dark, so any combination works (Default + Light, Default + Dark, Minimal + Light, Minimal + Dark).
- **Editor chrome only** — accents live in tabs, sidebar headers, the active workspace dot, the AI status indicator. The document content stays neutral so prose doesn't fight for attention with the chrome.
- **Configurable padding** — Settings → General now exposes top, side, and bottom padding sliders. Values apply to both Default and Minimal themes (the previous build only wired them up for Minimal).
- **Better code blocks in Minimal** — dark slate background with full syntax highlighting, instead of the previous flat grey selection look.
- **Full-width horizontal rules** — `---` now spans the full content column.

## AI in Mermaid diagrams

- **Edit via the main AI panel** — clicking the AI button on a diagram (or in fullscreen edit) registers a target with the panel, auto-pins the diagram source as scoped context, and switches the preamble into mermaid-edit mode. You get the full panel: model picker, multi-turn conversation, threads, snapshots — same surface you use for prose.
- **Live preview, explicit Apply** — every assistant reply is parsed for a `mermaid` fenced block. The diagram renders the proposal in place, with a chip in the panel showing **Apply ✓ / Discard × / Stop**. Apply commits to the node attrs; Discard keeps the conversation going; Stop ends the session.
- **Coexists with fullscreen edit** — you don't have to leave the fullscreen mermaid editor to use the AI. The panel sits on top (`z-index: 100000`) so both stay visible; minimising the chat restores the diagram to full width.
- **Robot icon, no more star** — the diagram AI button uses the same robot glyph as the main toolbar, so it's recognizable across the app.

## PDF export — closer to WYSIWYG

- **Match the editor** — the PDF now uses the same serif font (Charter / Iowan Old Style / Palatino) at the same scale (11.5 pt / 1.7 line-height) as the Minimal editor. What you see really is what you get.
- **Editor padding → PDF margins** — your top / side / bottom padding settings are applied as `body` padding inside `@media print`, so a tight editor prints with tight margins and a roomy editor prints generously. The fixed `@page` margin (10 mm safety) layers on top of that.
- **Code blocks keep their colours** — One-Dark palette (keyword purple, string green, number / attribute orange, comment grey, …) renders inside the PDF with `-webkit-text-fill-color` set explicitly so Chromium's PDF backend doesn't strip the colour. Background stays dark slate.
- **Inline code matches the editor** — coral text (`#e11d48`) on light grey, mirroring the Minimal theme's `--danger`-tinted inline code instead of the previous teal that diverged from both on-screen variants.
- **Tables size to content** — switched from `table-layout: fixed` (which spread one-word columns and long-URL columns to equal widths) to `auto`, so a `Method | Route | Handler` table reads the way it does in the editor.
- **Hidden chrome, real layout** — the workspace sidebar collapses to zero width (not just `display: none`, which left a flex reservation), all dialogs / overlays / drag artefacts are gone, the document fills the printable width 1:1.
- **No more dark-mode bleed** — earlier builds had `html.dark[data-variant="minimal"]` selectors out-ranking the print overrides; the print block now hard-pins the entire container chain to white with hex `#ffffff` instead of relying on cascading `--bg-primary`.

## UI polish

- **Resizable Mermaid editor split** — the divider between code and preview in fullscreen mermaid edit is draggable; the ratio is persisted into the markdown via node attrs (`splitRatio`) and survives roundtrip.
- **Resizable diagram in document** — drag the right edge of an inline mermaid block to set a custom width; persisted as `userWidth`.
- **Word-style zoom slider** — the editor zoom (Ctrl + Scroll, Ctrl+/-) now has a visible slider in the status bar with `±` buttons and percentage readout. Cleaner than the dropdown that lived there before.
- **Tab pin + context menu** — right-click a tab for **Pin / Unpin / Close / Close others / Close all but pinned / Close saved / Close all**. Pinned tabs reorder to the front and survive bulk-close.
- **Quick switcher with content search** — files and live full-text grep across the active workspace, behind `Ctrl+Shift+E`.
- **Split file-ops button** — the toolbar `+` is now two buttons: "New file" and "Open folder", so the workspace flow is one click instead of two.
- **Styled prompts and confirms** — the native `window.prompt` / `window.confirm` modals are replaced with themed dialogs everywhere (rename file, delete file, conflict resolution, …).

## Bug fixes

- **`os error 123` on Windows when the AI is asked to edit a fresh / unsaved file** — both `claude` and `codex` were getting an empty `work_dir` which Windows rejects on `Command::current_dir`. The Rust spawn helpers now fall back to `$HOME` / `$USERPROFILE` / `.` when the work dir is empty.
- **`codex --cd ""` rejection** — same root cause on the codex side; `--cd` is now only set to a real path, and `--add-dir` is skipped when no work dir is known.
- **Claude / Codex CLI on macOS / Linux** (#70 — also in 0.2.3) — GUI launches inherit a minimal `PATH` so installs from Homebrew / npm-global / volta / nvm / bun / asdf were not detected. The resolver now walks a curated list of standard install dirs and falls back to a login-shell probe (`$SHELL -lc 'command -v <name>'`); Settings → AI → CLI exposes a custom-path override with the actual list of locations the app searched, so you can see what was tried.
- **AI mermaid modal not appearing on first click** — nested `<Teleport>` inside the editor fullscreen sometimes failed to mount; the modal renders in place now (and as of this release is replaced by the main AI panel anyway).
- **PDF dark-mode bleed** — multiple iterations to defeat scoped Vue styles + `html.dark[data-variant]` rules; the entire container chain is now hex-pinned to `#ffffff` in print.
- **PDF top margin too large in Minimal** — Minimal's `padding-top: 32px` stacked on top of the `@page :first` margin and gave a 2 cm gap; print now zeroes editor padding and uses `body` padding routed from your editor settings.
- **Autolink URL appendix** — TipTap autolinks `CLAUDE.md` into `<a href="http://CLAUDE.md">`, and the previous `a::after { content: " (" attr(href) ")" }` rule then printed `CLAUDE.md (http://CLAUDE.md)` next to every plain-text mention. The URL appendix is gone; PDFs embed real hyperlinks anyway.
- **Mermaid `<select>` % dropdown jankiness** — the native dropdown stole the popup layer inside the floating toolbar and the active option visually shifted on every render; replaced by four buttons (25 / 50 / 75 / 100).
- **Default mermaid scale 25 → 100** — new diagrams render at full size by default; the previous 25 % default left them tiny in the document.
- **Workspace sidebar visible in PDF** — `display: none` left a flex width reservation; the sidebar now collapses with `width: 0; visibility: hidden`.
- **AI panel tab visible in fullscreen mermaid edit** — when minimised during a mermaid AI session, the tab needs to sit above the diagram fullscreen overlay. `z-index: 100000` is now applied conditionally so it only outranks the overlay during an active mermaid edit.
- **Claude AI on Windows — `batch file arguments are invalid`** (from 0.2.5) — Claude CLI resolves to `claude.cmd` (npm shim); Rust 1.77+ rejects `.cmd` invocations with newline-bearing args (CVE-2024-24576 mitigation). The system preamble is multi-line. Spawn now uses the documented `--input-format stream-json` path universally and folds the preamble into the user message text — same pattern as the Codex spawn.
- **Codex error events surface in the chat** (from 0.2.5) — Codex's top-level `error` / `turn.failed` envelopes were being dropped by the stdout normalizer; users got a generic *"AI process exited without finalising the turn"* instead of the real reason (e.g. *"The 'gpt-5' model is not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account."*). The normalizer now matches both shapes and unwraps the upstream API message.
- **Last-stderr tail attached to "exited without finalising" errors** (from 0.2.5) — when an AI child genuinely dies without emitting a final JSON event the synthesised error chunk now includes the last 20 lines of the child's stderr so you don't need a debug build to diagnose it.
- **Settings → AI shows resolved binary path** (from 0.2.5) — under the version line for each CLI you can see the actual path the resolver picked (`C:\Users\…\AppData\Roaming\npm\claude.cmd`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/codex`, your custom override, …). Makes it obvious which install is in use.
- **Right-click open** (#73, from 0.2.4) — context-menu *Open with MerMark* on Windows now actually opens the file instead of failing silently.
- **Drop file from workspace tree onto split pane** — drag a file out of the sidebar onto the left or right pane in split mode and it opens there. Works on empty panes too. Capture-phase listeners outrank TipTap/ProseMirror's own dragover handler so the cursor doesn't stick in not-allowed.
- **Click on workspace file with zero tabs open** — after Close All, clicking a workspace file used to do nothing because `loadFileIntoTab` short-circuited on `findActiveTabIndex() === -1`. Falls through to `createNewTab` now.
- **Window stays open after Close All when a workspace is open** — closing the last tab no longer terminates the window when at least one workspace is loaded; the sidebar stays useful for browsing, dragging, and quick-switching.
- **Typing lag on big docs** — `useToolbarActions` is called by ~20 components (Toolbar / LeftBar / StatusBar / each ToolbarItemRenderer); each used to register its own `editor.on('update')` listener that ran `getHTML` + `htmlToMarkdown` + token recount. With many tables / code blocks this stalled typing for hundreds of milliseconds per character. Listener + token counter hoisted to module scope (one per editor); typing is responsive again.

## Under the hood

- **AI CLI path cache** — once a `claude` / `codex` binary is resolved, the path is stored in settings (`cliResolvedPathClaude` / `cliResolvedPathCodex`) and reused on subsequent probes. Cold-start health checks are now near-instant on machines where the resolver had to do a login-shell probe.
- **Settings migration** — `useSettings` deep-merges new fields on load (`editorPaddingTop / Bottom / X`, `openWorkspaces[]`, `activeWorkspaceId`, `cliResolvedPath*`), so existing installs upgrade without losing anything.
- **Markdown roundtrip for mermaid attrs** — node attributes (`userWidth`, `splitRatio`, `printScale`) survive markdown serialization via a `<!--mermaid-attrs:k=v,…-->` HTML comment immediately before the fenced block, parsed back into TipTap node attrs on load.
- **`useAiMermaidTarget` singleton** — clean bridge between the diagram node and the AI panel. The node only registers a target with `apply` and `cancel` callbacks; the singleton tracks the candidate and exposes `applyCandidate` / `discardCandidate` / `clear`. Adding new "AI edits this kind of node" surfaces will use the same pattern.
- **`useToolbarActions` listener deduped** — Toolbar / LeftBar / StatusBar / every ToolbarItemRenderer call site used to register its own `editor.on('update')` handler, so each keystroke ran ~20 copies of `getHTML` + `htmlToMarkdown` + token recount. The listener and the token counter are now hoisted to module scope (one per editor); typing on docs with many tables / code blocks no longer stalls.
