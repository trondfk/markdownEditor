# Release v0.2.8 — Workspaces, Minimal Theme, AI in Diagrams

Workspace folders, a brand-new Minimal theme, AI editing for Mermaid diagrams, a near-WYSIWYG PDF export — the editor finally feels like a place you can stay in for hours, not just a quick-note tool.

## Workspaces

- **Multi-root workspace sidebar** (#69) — open one folder, two folders, ten. Each gets a collapsible section with file tree, drag-to-reorder header, and per-workspace controls (search, new file, open folder, menu). The active workspace shows a colored dot.
- **Folder tree like Zettlr / Obsidian** — expand / collapse subdirectories, click a file to open in a new tab, right-click for OS-level reveal, rename, delete, new file / folder. Expanded folders are remembered between sessions.
- **AI sees the workspace** — when a file lives inside an open workspace, the AI preamble includes the workspace root as a *read-only* scope. Ask "summarize the meeting notes from the last two weeks" and the model can actually traverse the folder; writes still stay scoped to the active document.
- **Quick switcher** — `Ctrl+Shift+E` opens a 3-section command palette: workspaces, files (filename match), content (full-text grep across the active workspace, debounced 150 ms, capped at 5 000 files / 4 s / 200 hits so it never stalls a big tree).
- **Migration from v0.2.x** — existing `lastRoot` workspace settings are auto-migrated to the new `openWorkspaces[]` shape on first launch.

## Minimal theme

- **Mermaid-logo palette** — teal `#14b8a6` and coral `#f43f5e` over slate `#1a2028`. Light and dark variants both ship; the variant axis is orthogonal to light/dark, so any combination works (Default + Light, Default + Dark, Minimal + Light, Minimal + Dark).
- **Editor chrome only** — accents live in tabs, sidebar headers, the active workspace dot, the AI status indicator. The document content stays neutral so prose doesn't fight for attention with the chrome.
- **Configurable padding** — Settings → General now exposes top, side, and bottom padding sliders. Values apply to both Default and Minimal themes (the previous build only wired them up for Minimal).
- **Better code blocks in Minimal** — dark slate background with full syntax highlighting, instead of the previous flat grey selection look.
- **Full-width horizontal rules** — `---` now spans the full content column.

## AI in Mermaid diagrams

- **Edit via the main AI panel** — clicking the AI button on a diagram (or in fullscreen edit) registers a target with the panel, auto-pins the diagram source as scoped context, and switches the preamble into mermaid-edit mode. You get the full panel: model picker, multi-turn conversation, threads, snapshots — same surface you use for prose.
- **Live preview, explicit Apply** — every assistant reply is parsed for a `mermaid` fenced block. The diagram renders the proposal in place, with a chip in the panel showing **Apply ✓ / Discard × / Stop**. Apply commits to the node attrs; Discard keeps the conversation going; Stop ends the session.
- **Coexists with fullscreen edit** — you don't have to leave the fullscreen mermaid editor to use the AI. The panel sits on top (`z-index: 100000`) so both stay visible; minimising the chat restores the diagram to full width.
- **Robot icon, no more star** — the diagram AI button uses the same robot glyph as the main toolbar, so it's recognizable across the app.

## PDF export — closer to WYSIWYG

- **Match the editor** — the PDF now uses the same serif font (Charter / Iowan Old Style / Palatino) at the same scale (11.5 pt / 1.7 line-height) as the Minimal editor. What you see really is what you get.
- **Editor padding → PDF margins** — your top / side / bottom padding settings are applied as `body` padding inside `@media print`, so a tight editor prints with tight margins and a roomy editor prints generously. The fixed `@page` margin (10 mm safety) layers on top of that.
- **Code blocks keep their colours** — One-Dark palette (keyword purple, string green, number / attribute orange, comment grey, …) renders inside the PDF with `-webkit-text-fill-color` set explicitly so Chromium's PDF backend doesn't strip the colour. Background stays dark slate.
- **Inline code matches the editor** — coral text (`#e11d48`) on light grey, mirroring the Minimal theme's `--danger`-tinted inline code instead of the previous teal that diverged from both on-screen variants.
- **Tables size to content** — switched from `table-layout: fixed` (which spread one-word columns and long-URL columns to equal widths) to `auto`, so a `Method | Route | Handler` table reads the way it does in the editor.
- **Hidden chrome, real layout** — the workspace sidebar collapses to zero width (not just `display: none`, which left a flex reservation), all dialogs / overlays / drag artefacts are gone, the document fills the printable width 1:1.
- **No more dark-mode bleed** — earlier builds had `html.dark[data-variant="minimal"]` selectors out-ranking the print overrides; the print block now hard-pins the entire container chain to white with hex `#ffffff` instead of relying on cascading `--bg-primary`.

## UI polish

- **Resizable Mermaid editor split** — the divider between code and preview in fullscreen mermaid edit is draggable; the ratio is persisted into the markdown via node attrs (`splitRatio`) and survives roundtrip.
- **Resizable diagram in document** — drag the right edge of an inline mermaid block to set a custom width; persisted as `userWidth`.
- **Word-style zoom slider** — the editor zoom (Ctrl + Scroll, Ctrl+/-) now has a visible slider in the status bar with `±` buttons and percentage readout. Cleaner than the dropdown that lived there before.
- **Tab pin + context menu** — right-click a tab for **Pin / Unpin / Close / Close others / Close all but pinned / Close saved / Close all**. Pinned tabs reorder to the front and survive bulk-close.
- **Quick switcher with content search** — files and live full-text grep across the active workspace, behind `Ctrl+Shift+E`.
- **Split file-ops button** — the toolbar `+` is now two buttons: "New file" and "Open folder", so the workspace flow is one click instead of two.
- **Styled prompts and confirms** — the native `window.prompt` / `window.confirm` modals are replaced with themed dialogs everywhere (rename file, delete file, conflict resolution, …).

## Bug fixes

- **`os error 123` on Windows when the AI is asked to edit a fresh / unsaved file** — both `claude` and `codex` were getting an empty `work_dir` which Windows rejects on `Command::current_dir`. The Rust spawn helpers now fall back to `$HOME` / `$USERPROFILE` / `.` when the work dir is empty.
- **`codex --cd ""` rejection** — same root cause on the codex side; `--cd` is now only set to a real path, and `--add-dir` is skipped when no work dir is known.
- **Claude / Codex CLI on macOS / Linux** (#70 — also in 0.2.3) — GUI launches inherit a minimal `PATH` so installs from Homebrew / npm-global / volta / nvm / bun / asdf were not detected. The resolver now walks a curated list of standard install dirs and falls back to a login-shell probe (`$SHELL -lc 'command -v <name>'`); Settings → AI → CLI exposes a custom-path override with the actual list of locations the app searched, so you can see what was tried.
- **AI mermaid modal not appearing on first click** — nested `<Teleport>` inside the editor fullscreen sometimes failed to mount; the modal renders in place now (and as of this release is replaced by the main AI panel anyway).
- **PDF dark-mode bleed** — multiple iterations to defeat scoped Vue styles + `html.dark[data-variant]` rules; the entire container chain is now hex-pinned to `#ffffff` in print.
- **PDF top margin too large in Minimal** — Minimal's `padding-top: 32px` stacked on top of the `@page :first` margin and gave a 2 cm gap; print now zeroes editor padding and uses `body` padding routed from your editor settings.
- **Autolink URL appendix** — TipTap autolinks `CLAUDE.md` into `<a href="http://CLAUDE.md">`, and the previous `a::after { content: " (" attr(href) ")" }` rule then printed `CLAUDE.md (http://CLAUDE.md)` next to every plain-text mention. The URL appendix is gone; PDFs embed real hyperlinks anyway.
- **Mermaid `<select>` % dropdown jankiness** — the native dropdown stole the popup layer inside the floating toolbar and the active option visually shifted on every render; replaced by four buttons (25 / 50 / 75 / 100).
- **Default mermaid scale 25 → 100** — new diagrams render at full size by default; the previous 25 % default left them tiny in the document.
- **Workspace sidebar visible in PDF** — `display: none` left a flex width reservation; the sidebar now collapses with `width: 0; visibility: hidden`.
- **AI panel tab visible in fullscreen mermaid edit** — when minimised during a mermaid AI session, the tab needs to sit above the diagram fullscreen overlay. `z-index: 100000` is now applied conditionally so it only outranks the overlay during an active mermaid edit.
- **Claude AI on Windows — `batch file arguments are invalid`** (from 0.2.5) — Claude CLI resolves to `claude.cmd` (npm shim); Rust 1.77+ rejects `.cmd` invocations with newline-bearing args (CVE-2024-24576 mitigation). The system preamble is multi-line. Spawn now uses the documented `--input-format stream-json` path universally and folds the preamble into the user message text — same pattern as the Codex spawn.
- **Codex error events surface in the chat** (from 0.2.5) — Codex's top-level `error` / `turn.failed` envelopes were being dropped by the stdout normalizer; users got a generic *"AI process exited without finalising the turn"* instead of the real reason (e.g. *"The 'gpt-5' model is not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account."*). The normalizer now matches both shapes and unwraps the upstream API message.
- **Last-stderr tail attached to "exited without finalising" errors** (from 0.2.5) — when an AI child genuinely dies without emitting a final JSON event the synthesised error chunk now includes the last 20 lines of the child's stderr so you don't need a debug build to diagnose it.
- **Settings → AI shows resolved binary path** (from 0.2.5) — under the version line for each CLI you can see the actual path the resolver picked (`C:\Users\…\AppData\Roaming\npm\claude.cmd`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/codex`, your custom override, …). Makes it obvious which install is in use.
- **Right-click open** (#73, from 0.2.4) — context-menu *Open with MerMark* on Windows now actually opens the file instead of failing silently.
- **Drop file from workspace tree onto split pane** — drag a file out of the sidebar onto the left or right pane in split mode and it opens there. Works on empty panes too. Capture-phase listeners outrank TipTap/ProseMirror's own dragover handler so the cursor doesn't stick in not-allowed.
- **Click on workspace file with zero tabs open** — after Close All, clicking a workspace file used to do nothing because `loadFileIntoTab` short-circuited on `findActiveTabIndex() === -1`. Falls through to `createNewTab` now.
- **Window stays open after Close All when a workspace is open** — closing the last tab no longer terminates the window when at least one workspace is loaded; the sidebar stays useful for browsing, dragging, and quick-switching.
- **Typing lag on big docs** — `useToolbarActions` is called by ~20 components (Toolbar / LeftBar / StatusBar / each ToolbarItemRenderer); each used to register its own `editor.on('update')` listener that ran `getHTML` + `htmlToMarkdown` + token recount. With many tables / code blocks this stalled typing for hundreds of milliseconds per character. Listener + token counter hoisted to module scope (one per editor); typing is responsive again.

## Under the hood

- **AI CLI path cache** — once a `claude` / `codex` binary is resolved, the path is stored in settings (`cliResolvedPathClaude` / `cliResolvedPathCodex`) and reused on subsequent probes. Cold-start health checks are now near-instant on machines where the resolver had to do a login-shell probe.
- **Settings migration** — `useSettings` deep-merges new fields on load (`editorPaddingTop / Bottom / X`, `openWorkspaces[]`, `activeWorkspaceId`, `cliResolvedPath*`), so existing installs upgrade without losing anything.
- **Markdown roundtrip for mermaid attrs** — node attributes (`userWidth`, `splitRatio`, `printScale`) survive markdown serialization via a `<!--mermaid-attrs:k=v,…-->` HTML comment immediately before the fenced block, parsed back into TipTap node attrs on load.
- **`useAiMermaidTarget` singleton** — clean bridge between the diagram node and the AI panel. The node only registers a target with `apply` and `cancel` callbacks; the singleton tracks the candidate and exposes `applyCandidate` / `discardCandidate` / `clear`. Adding new "AI edits this kind of node" surfaces will use the same pattern.
- **`useToolbarActions` listener deduped** — Toolbar / LeftBar / StatusBar / every ToolbarItemRenderer call site used to register its own `editor.on('update')` handler, so each keystroke ran ~20 copies of `getHTML` + `htmlToMarkdown` + token recount. The listener and the token counter are now hoisted to module scope (one per editor); typing on docs with many tables / code blocks no longer stalls.
