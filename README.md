## Why MerMark Editor?

**MerMark Editor** combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of Mermaid diagrams in a beautiful, native desktop application. Perfect for developers, technical writers, and anyone who needs to create documentation with flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and other visualizations.

### Key Benefits

- **No cloud dependency** - Your documents stay on your computer
- **Native performance** - Built with Tauri for fast, lightweight operation
- **WYSIWYG editing** - See your formatted content as you type
- **Mermaid integration** - Create diagrams directly in your documents
- **Marp presentations** - Build slide decks in Markdown with a live preview and fullscreen present mode
- **Multi-root workspaces** - Open one folder or many; the AI sees them as scoped read-only context
- **Local AI assistant** - Talk to Claude, Codex, a fully offline Ollama model, or any OpenAI-compatible local server about your notes; they edit your files directly
- **Cross-platform** - Available on Windows, macOS and Linux

</p>

---

## Presentations (Marp)

Turn any note into a slide deck. Start a **Marp presentation** from the New menu (or open an existing deck), write your slides in plain Markdown, and watch them render live next to the editor. A dedicated toolbar lets you add slides, switch themes, set per-slide layouts, drop in backgrounds, toggle slide numbers, and change the font size — then present fullscreen.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/marp-presentation.png" alt="MerMark — Marp presentation with a live slide preview beside the editor" width="90%" />
</p>

- **Live split preview** - edit on the left, see the real slides on the right, scrolling in sync
- **Themes with previews** - gaia, default, uncover; pick from graphical thumbnails
- **Local and web images** - both render in the live preview and in exports
- **Present fullscreen** - advance with arrow keys, a click, or auto-advance

---

## Local AI Assistant

If you already pay for **Claude Code** or **OpenAI Codex** — or both — MerMark plugs that subscription straight into the editor. The AI panel speaks to the `claude` and `codex` CLIs you already have logged in, so every request goes through the account you're already paying for. No API key to generate. No second bill. No proxy sitting between you and your provider.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trondfk/markdownEditor/main/docs/release-notes/v0.2.0/ai-panel-overview.png" alt="AI panel overview" />
  <br>
  <em>AI panel docked next to the editor with model picker, threads dropdown, pinned fragments and live context bar</em>
</p>

### Use the subscription you already have

- **Claude Code or Codex on a Pro/Plus plan** — MerMark uses that login, no extra account.
- **No API token to manage** — the CLI handles auth, MerMark never sees your keys.
- **Direct to provider** — requests go from your machine straight to Anthropic or OpenAI; nothing else in between.
- **No telemetry** — zero data leaves the editor beyond the CLI call you'd run in a terminal yourself.
- **Switch providers per turn** — pick Claude for one chat, Codex for the next; all configured in one panel.

### Fully offline with Ollama

Prefer to keep everything on your own machine? Pick **Ollama** as the provider and chat against a local model — no account, no subscription, no network.

- **Requires a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) install** running on your machine (`ollama serve`); pull a model first (e.g. `ollama pull llama3`).
- **Models are listed automatically** from your local install (`/api/tags`) — the model dropdown fills with whatever you've pulled.
- **Streams replies** straight from the local HTTP API; token usage is surfaced in the context bar just like the cloud providers.
- **Configurable base URL** in *Settings → AI* (defaults to `http://localhost:11434`) if Ollama runs on another host or port.
- **Graceful when offline** — if Ollama isn't running, the provider shows as *Not running* with a clear hint instead of failing silently.

### Any OpenAI-compatible local server

Run your own model server? Pick **OpenAI-compatible** as the provider and point it at any server that speaks the OpenAI HTTP API — [llama.cpp `llama-server`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/tree/master/tools/server), LM Studio, vLLM, a local Mistral, or even Ollama's own `/v1` endpoint.

- **Speaks the OpenAI API** — `POST /v1/chat/completions` (streamed SSE) and `GET /v1/models`; no account, no subscription, no network beyond your server.
- **Models are listed automatically** from `/v1/models` — the dropdown fills with every model your server exposes.
- **Streams replies** straight from the local HTTP API; token usage is surfaced in the context bar just like the cloud providers.
- **Configurable base URL** in *Settings → AI* (defaults to `http://localhost:8080`); the `/v1` path is appended automatically, so a base that already ends in `/v1` is not doubled.
- **Graceful when offline** — if the server isn't running, the provider shows as *Not running* with a clear hint instead of failing silently.

### What it can do

- **Edit your markdown directly** — "rewrite this section, friendlier tone", "extract action items", "translate to English". Writes straight to disk atomically; the editor reloads.
- **Read across folders you authorize** — point the access map at a project folder and the AI sees yesterday's notes, your glossary, your style guide.
- **Modify peer files** — split a long doc into multiple notes, generate a summary alongside the source, build a TOC file for a folder.
- **Search the web** — toggle the `network` tool on when you need fresh information.
- **Run shell commands** — opt-in `bash` toggle for grepping notes, running a build, anything terminal. Default off.
- **Auto-snapshot every AI write** — one-click **Revert** if the result isn't what you wanted.

### Multi-fragment selection and image attachments

- Pin one or more highlighted fragments — Visual *and* Code view.
- The AI receives only those fragments, not the entire document.
- Toggle **Send** off to keep pins visible without sending this turn.
- Paste a screenshot (`Ctrl+V`), drag-drop an image, or pick from disk.
- 8 MB per image, png / jpg / gif / webp / bmp.
- Both Claude and Codex see the image.
- Sent images stay in chat history as thumbnails so you remember what you passed.

<p align="center">

  <br>
  <em>Pin multiple highlighted fragments before sending — each appears as a numbered chip in the composer</em>
</p>

### Tool calls visible in the chat

- Every tool the model invokes shows up inline as a dashed chip in the transcript.
- Chip carries the tool name and a one-line preview of the arguments.
- Click to expand a pretty-printed JSON view of the full call.
- Covers Read, Edit, Write, Bash, WebFetch, codex shell — all of them.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trondfk/markdownEditor/main/docs/release-notes/v0.2.0/tool-chips.png" alt="Tool call chips" />
  <br>
  <em>Every tool the AI uses (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, WebFetch, ...) shows up inline as an expandable chip</em>
</p>

### Per-document threads with context restore

- Every doc has its own scrollable thread history.
- **+** archives the current chat and starts a fresh one.
- Up to 50 threads per document, persisted in `localStorage`.
- Reopening an old thread restores the CLI, model, and reasoning effort you were using.

### Safety, auditability, per-document access control

- Per-document access map: explicit read paths, write paths, tool toggles.
- Add files with **+ File**, whole folders with **+ Folder**.
- Pre-edit snapshots auto-rotated (default 3 + pinned), one-click **Revert**.
- Statusbar dot: green / red / blinking-red (bypass on).
- Append-only audit log of every AI action, viewable in Settings.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trondfk/markdownEditor/main/docs/release-notes/v0.2.0/access-map.png" alt="Access map editor" />

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trondfk/markdownEditor/main/docs/release-notes/v0.2.0/snapshots.png" alt="Snapshot history" />
  <br>
  <em>Snapshot history — restore, pin, export or delete pre-edit revisions</em>
</p>

### Two providers, one panel

- Switch `claude` / `codex` from the chat header.
- Per-CLI defaults persist (last model, last effort).
- Token streaming with a thinking indicator until the first chunk arrives.
- Segmented context-usage bar — input, cache, free — pulled from the CLI's reported usage.
- Clickable links open through the editor's external-link confirm dialog.
- Send shortcut: `Ctrl+Enter` (Win/Linux), `Cmd+Enter` (macOS).
- Minimize to a side tab, fullscreen, close — all in the panel header.

### AI editing for Mermaid diagrams

- Click **AI** on any diagram (or in fullscreen mermaid edit) — the main panel auto-pins the diagram source as scoped context and switches its preamble into mermaid-edit mode.
- Same panel, same model picker, same multi-turn conversation you use for prose.
- Each assistant reply is parsed for a `mermaid` fenced block and rendered live in place of the saved diagram.
- **Apply ✓ / Discard × / Stop** buttons appear in the panel chip; Apply commits to the node, Discard keeps iterating, Stop ends the session.

The full feature list, including snapshot rotation, tmp-recovery on crashed sessions, multi-window-safe streaming and per-CLI session isolation, lives in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
